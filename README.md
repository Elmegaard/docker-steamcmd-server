# SteamCMD in Docker optimized for Unraid
This Docker will download and install SteamCMD. It will also install ArmA III and run it. 

**Install Note:** You must provide a valid Steam username and password with Steam Guard disabled (the user dosen't have to have the game in the library).

**Update Notice:** Simply restart the container if a newer version of the game is available.
